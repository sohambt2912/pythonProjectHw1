Hi Professor this is my first homewoork.
First i did the basic print hi and hello word.
Then I assigned a and b to numbers which I then added.
Following i created an imput asking if I am cool. If Person responds Yes then correct will be printed if person writes No then itll print incorrent. The N and Y have to be capital.
Finally based on what I learnt from programmng in high school I was able to create pentagons. I chose teh color of the pentagon and the background. The only input is teh amount of sides which later is used to divide 360 by to obtain the angles of each side.
